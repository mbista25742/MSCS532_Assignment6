# MSCS532_Assignment6
# Medians, Order Statistics, and Elementary Data Structures

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and performance analysis of various algorithms and data structures. The project focuses on two main topics: selection algorithms (both deterministic and randomized) and elementary data structures. The project is organized into two parts:

- **Part 1**: Selection Algorithms - Implementations of deterministic and randomized algorithms to find the k-th smallest element in an array.
- **Part 2**: Elementary Data Structures - Implementations of basic data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

## Files in the Repository

- **assignment6.pdf**: Contains the detailed description of the assignment, including the problem statement, theoretical analysis, and performance analysis.
- **deterministicSelection.py**: Implements the deterministic selection algorithm (Median of Medians) to find the k-th smallest element in an array in worst-case linear time.
- **randomizedQuickSelect.py**: Implements the randomized selection algorithm (Randomized Quickselect) to find the k-th smallest element in expected linear time.
- **comparison.py**: Compares the running time of the deterministic and randomized selection algorithms across different input sizes and distributions (e.g., random, sorted, reverse-sorted).
- **elementaryDataStructure.py**: Implements basic data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists from scratch using Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries or dependencies are required for the basic implementation of these algorithms and data structures.

## Running the Code

To run the selection algorithms and data structures:
python3 filename
